Application startup
1) This phase includes the essential steps to prepare the application for user interaction, including creating and displaying the main form. 
2) Main method runs: The application's entry point, Main, is executed. This is where Application.Run(new Form1()) is typically called, starting the application's message loop.
3) Form constructor (Sub New): A new instance of the main form is created. The constructor is the first method to run and contains a call to InitializeComponent.
4) InitializeComponent: The method runs to construct all the controls on the form and set their initial properties. In Visual Studio, this code is auto-generated by the designer.
5) HandleCreated event: The window handle for the form is created. This happens before the form is visible to the user.
6) Form_Load event: This event fires before the form is displayed for the first time. It is the best place to run application-specific initialization logic, such as populating data or setting initial control states.
7) VisibleChanged event: Occurs when the form's Visible property changes, in this case, when it is being made visible.
8) Activated event: Occurs when the form becomes the active window, either by code or by user interaction. This will happen automatically for the main form when the application starts.
9) Shown event: This is the very last event in the startup sequence, fired after the form is fully visible and painted for the first time
