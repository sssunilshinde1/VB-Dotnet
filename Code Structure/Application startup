Application startup
1) This phase includes the essential steps to prepare the application for user interaction, including creating and displaying the main form. 
2) Main method runs: The application's entry point, Main, is executed. This is where Application.Run(new Form1()) is typically called, starting the application's message loop.
3) Form constructor (Sub New): A new instance of the main form is created. The constructor is the first method to run and contains a call to InitializeComponent.
4) InitializeComponent: The method runs to construct all the controls on the form and set their initial properties. In Visual Studio, this code is auto-generated by the designer.
5) HandleCreated event: The window handle for the form is created. This happens before the form is visible to the user.
6) Form_Load event: This event fires before the form is displayed for the first time. It is the best place to run application-specific initialization logic, such as populating data or setting initial control states.
7) VisibleChanged event: Occurs when the form's Visible property changes, in this case, when it is being made visible.
8) Activated event: Occurs when the form becomes the active window, either by code or by user interaction. This will happen automatically for the main form when the application starts.
9) Shown event: This is the very last event in the startup sequence, fired after the form is fully visible and painted for the first time.


Active user interaction
This phase involves events triggered by user actions or changes within the application while it is running.
1) Focus events: Events like Enter, Leave, GotFocus, and LostFocus fire as the user navigates between controls.
2) Mouse events: Actions like clicking, moving, or hovering the mouse over a control trigger events such as MouseClick, MouseEnter, and MouseLeave.
3) Keyboard events: Key presses or releases trigger KeyDown, KeyUp, and KeyPress events.
4) Painting and layout events: The Paint event is triggered when a control is redrawn, while Layout events fire when the form's layout changes.
5) Interaction with other forms: For applications with multiple forms, events like Activated and Deactivate fire as the user switches between them. 

Application shutdown
This phase handles the orderly closing of the application, freeing up resources, and saving data. 
1) Form_Closing event: This event is fired just before a form is closed. The event handler receives a FormClosingEventArgs object, which allows you to cancel the closing process if needed (for example, to prompt the user to save unsaved data).
2) Form_Closed event: This event is fired after the form has been closed and destroyed. It's the last event you can handle before the form instance is gone.
3) Application.Exit: The main message loop is closed, and the application exits.
4) Dispose method: The Dispose method on the form and its child controls is called to release any unmanaged resources. This happens after the form has been closed.
5) Garbage collection: The .NET garbage collector automatically reclaims the memory used by the form and other objects when they are no longer in use.
