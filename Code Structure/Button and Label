Button and Label

When is Me used?
To be explicit and improve readability: It's good practice to use Me to explicitly indicate that you are referring to a member of the current object. 

Is Me always necessary?
No. In most cases, if you omit Me, the compiler will automatically assume you are referring to the current instance. 
For example, Text = "Hello World App" would work just as well in your code.


Public Class Form1
    Inherits Form

    ' Declare controls at the class level
    Private WithEvents btnClickMe As Button
    Private WithEvents lblHelloWorld As Label

    Public Sub New()
        ' This call is required by the Windows Form Designer.
        InitializeComponent()
        ' Add any initialization after the InitializeComponent() call.
    End Sub

    ' The Form_Load event handler
    Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load
        ' Me.Text = "Hello World App"
        Text = "Hello World App"
        Me.Size = New System.Drawing.Size(300, 200)

        ' Create and configure a new Button control
        btnClickMe = New Button()
        btnClickMe.Text = "Click this button"
        btnClickMe.Location = New System.Drawing.Point(80, 50)
        Me.Controls.Add(btnClickMe)

        ' Create and configure a new Label control
        lblHelloWorld = New Label()
        lblHelloWorld.Text = "Label1"
        lblHelloWorld.Location = New System.Drawing.Point(80, 100)
        Me.Controls.Add(lblHelloWorld)
        Me.MaximizeBox = true
    End Sub

    ' The event handler for the button click
    Private Sub btnClickMe_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnClickMe.Click
        lblHelloWorld.Text = "Hello World!"
    End Sub

End Class
